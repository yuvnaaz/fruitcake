Easy Fruit Cake: Butter, or spray with a nonstick vegetable spray, a 9 x 5 x 3 inch (23 x 13 x 8 cm) loaf pan. Preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). (Note: if using a dark colored pan reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees F (160 degrees C).)
In a large saucepan, over medium heat, bring to a boil the sugar, water, butter, spices, and raisins. Boil for five minutes, then remove from heat, and let cool till lukewarm. Stir into this mixture the lightly beaten eggs, flour, baking soda, vanilla extract and candied fruit. Pour into your prepared pan and bake for 50 - 65 minutes or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and let cool on a wire rack. Cover and store, if possible, for a few days before serving. This fruit cake can be frozen.
